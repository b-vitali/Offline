#
* changes in JobConfig: 

* define default seeds in a useful way

* use scripting-style comments and tcl mode

* make sure all configurations in JobConfig use the same geometry 

   JobConfig/common/geom_baseline.txt = Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common.txt,
   do not retire JobConfig/common/geom_baseline.txt 

   this is what we want: smth like file:Mu2eG4/geom/geom_2019_PhaseI_hayman_v2.txt

   files , for which th changes have  been made:

* use Services.Sim from fcl/standardServices.fcl
