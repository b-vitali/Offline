  *General*

this package contains standard Mu2e job configuration files


- make sure all top level config files here include deometry definitions explicitly

- top level FCL is printed into the GRID job log files, having exlicit information 
  about the geometry there is critical

- <2020-05-25 Mon> : default geometry: file:../../Mu2eG4/geom/geom_2019_PhaseI_hayman_v2.txt


- for services, use Services.Sim from file:../../fcl/standardServices.fcl::Services.Sim 
   doesn't matter which one is used, what matters - is that only one
   - Yuri's style is nicer, but the one above has less redirections
